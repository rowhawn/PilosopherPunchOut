# PilosopherPunchOut
A Raspberry Pi based installation to transform physical punches into audible philosophical musings in real-time

Piezo-electric sensors mounted in padded mats register punches, which trigger text-to-speech vocalization of syllables taken from markov chain text generators trained on texts by authors/philosophers/rappers/poets. Two boxers allow for a simulated battle of wits between noteworthy wordsmiths.
